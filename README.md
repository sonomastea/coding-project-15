In project 15 we learned how to set up a react environment which for me took alot of trial and error. We then used it to create an about me page with things like skills, education, experience, and personal info. I then made individual java scripts to export into the main app.js for each of the criteria. Lastly I personalized a app.css to add some detailed features.
